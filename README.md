# Project Overview:

The desktop aid is an application layered on top of a desktop that helps users with ADHD or other attentive disorders to stay on task or be reminded of deadlines. It will include a visual element that is capable of interracting with the desktop environment to some capacity (i.e. dragging the mouse or appearing in front of the active window) with the goal of getting the user's attention for user specified tasks at user specified times. Depending on client specifications, the application may also interract with a previously existing scheduling application to automatically populate the task list.
